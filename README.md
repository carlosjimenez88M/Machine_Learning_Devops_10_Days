# 10 Days Machine Learning Practices and Modelling

The present repository is related to an exercise in implementing Machine Learning Ops, based on AI Programming and automatable solutions. Primarily, these exercises are based on the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron, third edition!

In some cases, I will develop solutions in Colab since I will use training agents offered by Weights and Biases. However, this will only be to define the model's architecture, and these links will be referenced in the development scripts.

The proposed content for this exercise will include:

### Some Observations:

- In some cases, I will develop the inference component, but as microservices, leveraging FastAPI, CI/CD, and Docker!
